_The Docket_ (UVA Law News) has an article about the AI Law class I'm helping Tom Nachbar teach:

[New Classes Explore Promise and Predicaments of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.law.virginia.edu/news/202503/new-classes-explore-promise-and-predicaments-artificial-intelligence)  
_Attorneys-in-Training Learn About Prompts, Policies and Governance_  
The Docket, 17 March 2025

> Nachbar teamed up with David Evans, a professor of computer science at UVA, to teach the course, which, he said, is “a big part of what makes this class work.”

> “This course takes a much more technical approach than typical law school courses do. We have the students actually going in, creating their own chatbots — they’re looking at the technology underlying generative AI,” Nachbar said. Better understanding how AI actually works, Nachbar said, is key in training lawyers to handle AI-related litigation in the future.

> “I want my students to have a solid understanding about what’s actually happening under the hood, as it were, so that when they confront a case, they know what kinds of questions to start asking,” he said.

Tom and I will co-teach a jointly-listed Law and Computer Science [AI Law class](https://uvalawai.github.io) in the fall.
