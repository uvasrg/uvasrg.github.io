Here's the slides from my [Cray Distinguished Speaker](https://cse.umn.edu/cs/cray) talk on [_On Leaky Models and Unintended Inferences_](https://cse.umn.edu/cs/events/cse-colloquium-leaky-models-and-unintended-inferences): [[PDF](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5gi766dqezsitw4/cray2022.pdf?dl=0)]

The chatGPT limerick version of my talk abstract is much better than mine:

> A machine learning model, oh so grand  
> With data sets that it held in its hand  
> It performed quite well  
> But secrets to tell  
> And an adversary's tricks it could not withstand.

Thanks to Stephen McCamant and Kangjie Lu for hosting my visit, and everyone at University of Minnesota. Also great to catch up with UVA BSCS alumn, [Stephen J. Guy](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~sjguy/).

The main works I talked about are:

- Anshuman Suri's work on [distribution inference](/on-the-risks-of-distribution-inference/) (Paper: [_Formalizing and Estimating Distribution Inference Risks_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06024), PETS 2022)

- Bargav Jayaraman's work on [attribute inference](/attribute-inference-attacks-are-really-imputation) (Paper: [_Are Attribute Inference Attacks Just Imputation?_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01292) ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01292)). [CCS 2022](https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2022/))

- Our new SaTML paper: [Anshuman Suri](http://anshumansuri.com/), Yifu Lu, Yanjin Chen, [David Evans](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/). [_Dissecting Distribution Inference_](https://www.anshumansuri.com/publication/dissecting/) (SaTML, 2023).

The talk from Randy Pausch (Cray Distinguished Speaker, 1999-2000) that I mentioned is available here: [_Time Management_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blaK_tB_KQA), November 2007.

The transcript of Seymour Cray's talk at the University of Virginia is

Professionals and Molecular Biologists Should Start
Collaborating)_](https://americanhistory.si.edu/comphist/montic/cray.htm). Remarks of Seymour Cray to the Shannon Center for Advanced Studies, University
of Virginia. 30 May 1996.
