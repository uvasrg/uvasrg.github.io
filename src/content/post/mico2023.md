[Anshuman Suri](https://www.anshumansuri.com) wrote up an interesting
post on his experience with the [MICO
Challenge](https://github.com/microsoft/MICO), a membership inference
competition that was part of [SaTML](https://satml.org/). Anshuman
placed second in the competition (on the CIFAR data set), where the
metric is highest true positive rate at a 0.1 false positive rate over
a set of models (some trained using differential privacy and some
without).

Anshuman's post describes the methods he used and his experience in
the competition: [_My submission to the MICO
Challenge_](https://www.anshumansuri.com/post/mico/).
