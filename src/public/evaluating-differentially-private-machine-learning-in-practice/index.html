        <p>(Cross-post by <a href="https://bargavjayaraman.github.io/post/evaluating-dpml-results/">Bargav Jayaraman</a>)</p>
<p>With the recent advances in composition of differential private
mechanisms, the research community has been able to achieve meaningful
deep learning with privacy budgets in single digits. Rènyi
differential privacy (RDP) is one mechanism that provides tighter
composition which is widely used because of its implementation in
TensorFlow Privacy (recently, Gaussian differential privacy (GDP) has
shown a tighter analysis for low privacy budgets, but it was not yet
available when we did this work). But the central question that
remains to be answered is: <em>how private are these methods in
practice?</em></p>
<p>In this blog post, we answer this question by empirically evaluating
the privacy leakage of differential private neural networks via
membership inference attacks. This work appeared in <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity19">USENIX
Security'19</a> (full
paper:
[<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08874">arXiv</a>]
[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAGhqbY_U50">talk video</a>]).</p>
<h2 id="training-differentially-private-models">Training Differentially Private Models</h2>
<p>We train two-layer neural network models using a training procedure
similar to the popular <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.00133.pdf">DPSGD</a>
procedure. The training and test sets consist of seperate 10,000
instances randomly sampled from the
<a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html">CIFAR-100</a> data set.</p>
<p>The figure below shows the accuracy loss of private models trained
with naïve composition (NC) and Rènyi differential
privacy (RDP) with respect to a non-private model. As expected, models
trained with RDP achieve much better utility when compared to the
models trained with NC. To give a comparison, models trained with RDP
achieve 53% accuracy loss at \(\epsilon = 10\), whereas the models
trained with NC achieve the same utility at \(\epsilon = 500\). Due
to the tighter composition, RDP mechanism adds much lesser noise when
compared to NC mechanism for the same privacy budget.</p>
<p>This is great, but what about the privacy leakage?

</p>
<h2 id="privacy-comes-at-a-cost">Privacy comes at a cost</h2>
<p>To estimate privacy leakage, we implement the membership inference
attack of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.01604.pdf">Yeom et al</a> and use
their membership advantage metric, which is given as the difference
between true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) of
detecting whether a given instance is a part of the training set. This
metric lies between 0 and 1, where 0 signifies no privacy leakage.</p>
<p>As the figure below depicts, there is a clear trade-off between
privacy and utility. While the RDP mechanism achieves higher utility,
it also suffers from higher privacy leakage. The attack achieves
around 0.40 membership advantage score against model trained with RDP
at \(\epsilon = 1000\), with a positive predictive value (PPV) of
74%. While this is less than the privacy leakage of non-private model
(highlighted in the figure below), it is a significant amount of
leakage. On the other hand, the model has almost no utility at lower
privacy budgets where the privacy leakage is low.  <figure><img src="/images/evaluatingdpml/priv_leak.jpg">
</figure>
 A more interesting observation is that we
only have tight theoretical worst case guarantees on membership
advantage for \(\epsilon &lt; 1\), at which point the models neither
have any utility nor have any empirical privacy leakage. While the
attacks only give a lower bound on the privacy leakage, the huge gap
between the theoretical upper bound and the empirical lower bound
suggests that there could be stronger attacks in practice.</p>
<h2 id="leakage-is-not-random">Leakage is not random</h2>
<p>We have shown above that the membership inference attack can be
effective against a model trained with RDP at \(\epsilon =
1000\). The members identified by the attacker are not due to the
randomness in machine learning process. To show this, we run run the
above experiment multiple times and note the fraction of members that
are repeatedly identified across different runs. The figure below
shows the results. The attacker is able to identify almost a quarter
of the training records with more than 82% PPV across five runs. If
the leakage was due to the randomness, we would have expected a trend
similar to the dotted line.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The differential privacy research community has come a long way to
realize practical mechanisms for privacy-preserving deep
learning. However, as shown in our work, we still require significant
improvements to achieve meaningful utility for privacy budgets where
we have strong theoretical guarantees. Concurrently, the huge gap
between the empirical privacy leakage and the theoretical bounds opens
the possibility for more powerful inference attacks in practice.</p>
