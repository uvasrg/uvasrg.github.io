      <description>Congratulations to Anshuman Suri for successfully defending his PhD thesis!&#xA;Tianhao Wang, Dr. Anshuman Suri, Nando Fioretto, Cong Shen&#xA;On Screen: David Evans, Giuseppe Ateniese Inference Privacy in Machine Learning Using machine learning models comes at the risk of leaking information about data used in their training and deployment. This leakage can expose sensitive information about properties of the underlying data distribution, data from participating users, or even individual records in the training data.</description>

      <description>MIMIR logo. Image credit: GPT-4 + DALL-E Paper Code Data Membership inference attacks (MIAs) attempt to predict whether a particular datapoint is a member of a target model&amp;rsquo;s training data. Despite extensive research on traditional machine learning models, there has been limited work studying MIA on the pre-training data of large language models (LLMs).&#xA;We perform a large-scale evaluation of MIAs over a suite of language models (LMs) trained on the Pile, ranging from 160M to 12B parameters.</description>

      <description>Manipulating Transfer Learning for Property Inference Transfer learning is a popular method to train deep learning models efficiently. By reusing parameters from upstream pre-trained models, the downstream trainer can use fewer computing resources to train downstream models, compared to training models from scratch.&#xA;The figure below shows the typical process of transfer learning for vision tasks:&#xA;However, the nature of transfer learning can be exploited by a malicious upstream trainer, leading to severe risks to the downstream trainer.</description>

      <description>(Cross-post by Anshuman Suri)&#xA;Distribution inference attacks aims to infer statistical properties of data used to train machine learning models. These attacks are sometimes surprisingly potent, as we demonstrated in previous work.&#xA;KL Divergence Attack Most attacks against distribution inference involve training a meta-classifier, either using model parameters in white-box settings (Ganju et al., Property Inference Attacks on Fully Connected Neural Networks using Permutation Invariant Representations, CCS 2018), or using model predictions in black-box scenarios (Zhang et al.</description>

      <title>Attribute Inference attacks are really Imputation</title>

      <description>Post by Bargav Jayaraman&#xA;Attribute inference attacks have been shown by prior works to pose privacy threat against ML models. However, these works assume the knowledge of the training distribution and we show that in such cases these attacks do no better than a data imputataion attack that does not have access to the model. We explore the attribute inference risks in the cases where the adversary has limited or no prior knowledge of the training distribution and show that our white-box attribute inference attack (that uses neuron activations to infer the unknown sensitive attribute) surpasses imputation in these data constrained cases.</description>

      <description>I gave a talk in the Berryville Institute of Machine Learning in the Barn series on What Machine Learnt Models Reveal, which is now available as an edited video:&#xA;David Evans, a professor of computer science researching security and privacy at the University of Virginia, talks about data leakage risk in ML systems and different approaches used to attack and secure models and datasets. Juxtaposing adversarial risks that target records and those aimed at attributes, David shows that differential privacy cannot capture all inference risks, and calls for more research based on privacy experiments aimed at both datasets and distributions.</description>

      <title>On the Risks of Distribution Inference</title>

      <description>(Cross-post by Anshuman Suri)&#xA;Inference attacks seek to infer sensitive information about the training process of a revealed machine-learned model, most often about the training data.&#xA;Standard inference attacks (which we call “dataset inference attacks”) aim to learn something about a particular record that may have been in that training data. For example, in a membership inference attack (Reza Shokri et al., Membership Inference Attacks Against Machine Learning Models, IEEE S&amp;amp;P 2017), the adversary aims to infer whether or not a particular record was included in the training data.</description>
