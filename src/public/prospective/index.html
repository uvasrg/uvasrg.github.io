Advice on Contacting Faculty<br>
for Prospective Research Students<br>
</center>
</h1>
<p>Like most professors, I get several hundred emails a year from
prospective students interested in coming to our university for graduate
school and joining my research group.  I try to reply to all messages
that are not obviously spam, but find most messages I receive make me
less likely to want to accept the students sending them.</p>
<p>This page provides some advice for prospective grad school applicants considering
emailing me, but most of it probably applies to any other professor you
want to contact also.</p>
<h2 id="who-to-contact">Who To Contact</h2>
<p>Its a <em>really</em> bad idea to send spam emails to long lists of
professors.  These emails will never help you, and some professors will
maintain blacklists of applicants who do this to make sure their
application is rejected without consideration.</p>
<p>Your goal in sending email is not to contact as many professors as you
can, but to identify a few professors who you might want as your
research advisor and then to find which of those seem most promising
as advisors and convince them that you would be a worthwhile student.</p>
<p>You should only contact professors with whom you have a genuine interest
in working based on knowing something about them and what they do.  You
can find out about professors&rsquo; research by looking at their web pages
(professors who don&rsquo;t have web pages about their research are either not
interested in recruiting students, not doing any research, or so famous
they probably have someone to filter their email for them).</p>
<h2 id="do-your-homework">Do Your Homework</h2>
<p>Before contacting a potential advisor, do your homework: read the
advisor&rsquo;s home page (mine is <a href="//www.cs.virginia.edu/evans/"><em><a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/evans/">www.cs.virginia.edu/evans/</a></em></a>,
and our group blog is <a href="//uvasrg.github.io/"><em>uvasrg.github.io</em></a>)
and at least one recent paper (<a
href="//www.cs.virginia.edu/evans/pubs/">my papers</a>).</p>
<p>If doing this doesn&rsquo;t give you any interesting ideas, this
is probably not someone with whom you want to do research so you
shouldn&rsquo;t waste time contacting her or him.  If it does, send a short
introductory email.</p>
<h2 id="first-email">First Email</h2>
<p>A typical message should go something like this:</p>
<div id="email">
<table cellpadding=6 class="texttable" bgcolor="#DEF">
<tr valign=bottom bgcolor="#DEF">
<td bgcolor="#DEF"><tt>From: Flipper Wordsfish &lt;flipper@adou.edu&gt;</tt><br>
<tt>Subject: Student Interested in TSU Problem</tt>
</td>
<td align=left width=40% bgcolor="#FFFFCC">
Make sure your from address and subject lines are useful</td>
</tr>
<tr valign=bottom bgcolor="#DEF">
<td bgcolor="#DEF" valign=bottom><tt>Dear Professor Nemo,</tt></td>
<td align=left width=40% bgcolor="#FFFFCC">Greeting: its safest to be a bit formal here.</td>
</tr>
<tr> <td bgcolor="#DEF"><tt> I will be finishing a BS degree in Underwater
Mathematics at the Atlantis Deep Ocean University this year.  I am
considering applying to UVA's PhD program and would be interested
joining your Octople Cryptology research group.
<p></tt></td></p>
<td align=left bgcolor="#FFFFCC">
<p>Briefly introduce yourself in at most two sentences.  Don&rsquo;t tell your
whole life story.  Be direct and clear about applying to grad school.</td></p>
</tr> <tr bgcolor="#DEF"> <td bgcolor="#DEF"><tt>I found your paper, "A Linear-Time Solution to the
Travelling Sea Urchin Problem", on your website
(http://www.smith.org/urchin.html).  I was fascinated by your result,
especially as I have spent several summers studying the similar
travelling sea cucumber problem as an intern at Microshifty Corp in
the Attle Sea.  You can find a paper about my work on this at
http://www.flipper.com/research/tscp.html.</tt></td>
<td align=left bgcolor="#FFFFCC">
<p>Explain specifically what you read and where you found it (people
sometimes publish several papers with similar names and forget which is
which). A touch of flattery never hurts, but don&rsquo;t go overboard.  If
appropriate, relate it to your background and interests and briefly
plug your work.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr> <td bgcolor="#DEF"><tt>I believe your result is even more important than
your paper implies, since it can be extended to solve the Travelling
Salescritter Problem and thus to prove P = NP.</tt></td>
<td align=left bgcolor="#FFFFCC">Concisely describe your
insight or why you are interested in the work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#DEF"><tt>
<p>Do you think it would be worthwhile to pursue this line of research?
If you are interested, I can send you a proof sketch.</tt></td></p>
<td
align=left bgcolor="#FFFFCC">End with a clear, simple question.<br>Offer a suggestion
on how to proceed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#DEF"><tt>Regards,<br>Flipper Wordsfish (flipper@adou.edu)</tt></td> <td
align=left bgcolor="#FFFFCC">Closing &mdash; make sure to include <a
href="//www.cs.virginia.edu/evans/advice/your.html">your</a> name and email address.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>Of course, your insight isn&rsquo;t likely to be so significant as
Flipper&rsquo;s.  But, you should make an effort to raise an interesting
question about the work described in the paper, to suggest extensions
or applications of the work, or to relate it directly to something you
have done.</p>
<p>It is definitely worth taking time to write clearly and consisely
using correct spelling and grammar.  As with all emails, the message
should be broken into short paragraphs, the sentences should be simple
and straightforward.</p>
<h2 id="what-not-to-do">What Not To Do</h2>
<p>Never do any of these:</p>
<ul>
<li> Don't send information about your GRE scores, GPA, class rank,
cholesterol levels, favorite movies, etc. and ask what your chances of
admission are.  Standardized tests and grades have minimal influence
on your chances of admission and reveal very little about your
potential as a researcher.  No one can or should tell you anything
about your chances of admission based on an email (other than that you
are more likely to be rejected now since you sent an annoying email).
<li> Don't send a first email longer than a typical screenful.  You
should be able to get across everything you need in a first 
email concisely and use longer emails if technical depth is required in
follow ups.  
<li> Don't waste space and time telling me how hard-working,
creative and smart you are &mdash; demonstrate it with the contents of
your message.  
<li> Don't waste space and time telling me how brilliant I am.  The
fact that you are interested in joining my research group is flattery
enough.
<li> Don't make generic statements about being interested in my work or
how well it relates to your interests. Most professors have projects in
several different areas and can't figure out what you mean unless you
describe a specific connection or interest.
<li> Don't attach anything to your email.  If you want to provide
additional content, you should do this by sending a URL (as plain
text, not a link).  It is useful to have a personal website that is
fairly professional, and that conveys something about your experience
and research interests. Its great if you have a blog post or two about
something interesting you've learned or done. If you are applying to
CS graduate programs, your personal website shouldn't be a LinkedIn
page or some other site where you do not have full control over the
content. There are lots of good free hosting sites (I often use github
pages, but there are plenty of other good options). If you are not
able to create a web page, you probably shouldn't be applying to CS
graduate programs.
<li> Be aware that most email is filtered out by spam filters these
days and never reaches the intended recipient. If you are a non-native
English speaker sending email to someone at an English-speaking
instutition, make sure your "From:" address appears using the English
alphabet. Using characters that are not standard English in your email
increases the risk that it will be filtered out as spam.  I do realize
it is very unfair for us to expect you to change your name for our
convenience and cultural ignorance!  But, once you get admitted you
can and should tell people what you want them to call you. (Note that
for your formal application it may be necessary to use a Westernized
version of your name to comply with the application form, so if you
use another name in your email communications with faculty, it is
important to also provide the name you use in your application so they
can identify the corresponding application.  This is a good
opportunity to refresh the relationship after you send in your
application by informing your contact to the formal name used in your
application.)
</li>
<li> Don't use any fancy formatting in your email (including your
message signature). 
</li>     
</ul>

</p>
<h2 id="follow-up">Follow Up</h2>
<p>Since most professors get lots of email, there is some chance that
even if you do everything right, your message will get lost in my
inbox and you won&rsquo;t get a reply.  If you don&rsquo;t get a reply after about
a week, send a follow up email that politely asks if the message was
received and includes the previous message.  If you still don&rsquo;t get a
response, that&rsquo;s a pretty good sign that the potential professor you
are contacting either has an overly-agressive spam filter, or is not
someone you want as your advisor.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Getting into a good PhD program is extremely competitive and
professors are strongly motivated to identify and attract the best
possible research students to their group.  At any department you would
want to go to (including <a href="//www.cs.virginia.edu/">UVA</a>),
the acceptance rate is usually in the single digit percentages.  At the most
competitive departments, only a few slots every year are awarded to
students without recommendation letters from people the faculty know
well.</p>
<p>It takes work to find the right PhD program and advisor, but contacting
potential advisors directly is your best way to find a research group
that matches your interests and goals well and possibly to improve your
chances of being admitted.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve read and followed these directions, please feel free to
contact me about coming to UVA to do a PhD in Computer Science.  Your
goal is to start an interesting email conversation about research
ideas.</p>
