<p>Machine learning poses a substantial risk that adversaries will be
able to discover information that the model does not intend to
reveal. One set of methods by which consumers can learn this sensitive
information, known broadly as <em>membership inference</em> attacks,
predicts whether or not a query record belongs to the training set. A
basic membership inference attack involves an attacker with a given
record and black-box access to a model who tries to determine whether
said record was a member of the model’s training set.</p>
<p>Unlike much of the existing research on the membership inference,
though, these particular results focus on what are considered
“realistic assumptions,” including conditions with skewed
priors (wherein members only make up a small fraction of the candidate
pool) and conditions with adversaries that select accuracy-improving
inference thresholds based on specific attack goals. These new
assumptions help to answer the question of how differential privacy
can be implemented to provide meaningful privacy guarantees in
practice.</p>

<h2 id="threshold-selection">Threshold Selection</h2>
<p>In order to classify a record as either a member or a non-member,
there must be a threshold that converts a real number output from a
test into a Boolean. We develop a procedure to select a threshold,
φ, that allows the adversary to achieve as much privacy leakage as
possible while staying beneath a maximum false positive rate, α.</p>
<p>This selection procedure can be applied to any membership inference
attack, including Yeom’s attack. The original version of this
attack classifies a record as a member if its per-instance-loss is
less than the expected training loss, whereas this new approach
selects members based on a threshold <em>φ</em>, which can be set
to target a particular false positive rate.</p>
<center>
<img alt="" src="/images/revisiting/image2.png" width="80%">
</center>
<h2 id="the-merlin-attack">The Merlin Attack</h2>
<p>In addition to this new selection procedure, we introduce a new attack
known as Merlin, which stands for <B>ME</b>asuring <b>R</b>elative <b>L</b>oss <b>I</b>n <b>N</b>eighborhood. Instead of per-instance-loss, this attack uses the
direction of change of per-instance-loss when the record is slightly
perturbed with noise. Merlin operates based on the intuition that, as
a result of overfitting, member records are more likely to be near
local minima than non-member records. This suggests that for members,
loss is more likely to increase at perturbed points near the original,
whereas it is equally likely to increase or decrease for
non-members. For each record, a small amount of random Gaussian noise
is added and the change of loss direction is recorded. This process is
repeated multiple times and Merlin infers membership based on the
fraction of times the loss increases.</p>
<center>
<img alt="" src="/images/revisiting/image3.png" width="80%">
</center>
<h2 id="the-morgan-attack">The Morgan Attack</h2>
<p>Since Yeom and Merlin use different information to make their
membership inferences, they do not always identify the same records as
members; some members are more vulnerable to one attack than the
other. Visualizing a combination of the attacks’ results
suggests that by eliminating the results with a very low
per-instance-loss, a combination of the two may produce an improved
PPV. The intuition here is that extremely low per-instance-losses may
result in Merlin’s identification of a local minimum where there
is in fact a near global minimum (which is much less strongly
correlated with membership).</p>
<p>The Morgan (<b>M</b>easuring l<b>O</b>ss, <b>R</b>elatively
<B>G</b>reater <b>A</b>round <b>N</b>eighborhood) attack uses three
different thresholds: a lower threshold on per-instance loss (<em>φ</em><sub><em>L</em></sub>),
an upper threshold on per-instance loss (<em>φ</em><sub><em>U</em></sub>),
and a threshold on the ratio as used by Merlin (<em>φ</em><sub><em>M</em></sub>). If a
record has a per-instance-loss that falls between <em>φ</em><sub><em>L</em></sub> and <em>φ</em><sub><em>U</em></sub>, and has a Merlin ratio of at least <em>φ</em><sub><em>M</em></sub>, Morgan identifies it as a member.</p>

<p>The figure shows the per-instance loss and Merlin ratio for
Purchase-100X (and expanded version of the Purchase-100 dataset that
we created for our experiments). Members and nonmembers are denoted
by orange and purple points respectively. The boxes show the
thresholds found by the threshold selection process (without access to
the training data, but with the same data distribution), and
illustrate the regions where members are identified by Morgan with
very high confidence (PPV ∼1). (See <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10881">paper</a> for details, and more result.)</p>
</div>
</center>
<h2 id="imbalanced-priors">Imbalanced Priors</h2>
<p>Previous work on membership inference attacks assumes a candidate pool
where half of the candidates are members. For most settings,
especially ones where there is a serious privacy risk for an
individual of being identified as a dataset member, this assumption is
unrealistic. It is important to understand how well inference attacks
work when the adversary&rsquo;s candidate pool has a different prior
probability of being amember.</p>
<center>
<img alt="" src="/images/revisiting/image6.png" width="60%">
</center>
<p>Here, the candidate pool from which the attacker attempts to select
members has <em>γ</em> times more non-member records than member
records. As shown above, even in situations that other papers do not
consider, wherein there are many times more non-members than members,
attacks are able to attain a high rate of positively-identified
members.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Merlin and Morgan attacks can reliably identify members even in
situations with imbalanced priors where other attacks fail to show
meaningful inference risk.</p>
<p>There remains a large gap between what can be guaranteed using
differential privacy methods, and what can be inferred using known
inference attacks. This means better inference attacks may exist, and
our results show that there are concrete ways to improve attacks
(e.g., our threshold-selection procedure) and to incorporate more
information to improve attacks. We are especially interested in
attacks that produce extremely high PPVs, even if this is only for a
small fraction of candidates, since for most scenarios this is where
the most serious privacy risks lie.</p>
