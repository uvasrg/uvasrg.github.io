      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m quoted in this story by Rob Lemos about poisoning code models (the CodeBreaker paper in USENIX Security 2024 by Shenao Yan, Shen Wang, Yue Duan, Hanbin Hong, Kiho Lee, Doowon Kim, and Yuan Hong), that considers a similar threat to our TrojanPuzzle work:&#xA;Researchers Highlight How Poisoned LLMs Can Suggest Vulnerable Code&#xA;Dark Reading, 20 August 2024&#xA;CodeBreaker uses code transformations to create vulnerable code that continues to function as expected, but that will not be detected by major static analysis security testing.</description>

      <description>Maggie Makar organized a celebration for the 75th birthday of my PhD advisor, John Guttag.&#xA;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to attend in person, unfortunately, but the occasion provided an opportunity to create a poster that looks back on what I&amp;rsquo;ve done since I started working with John over 30 years ago.</description>

      <title>Adjectives Can Reveal Gender Biases Within NLP Models</title>

      <description>Post by Jason Briegel and Hannah Chen&#xA;Because NLP models are trained with human corpora (and now, increasingly on text generated by other NLP models that were originally trained on human language), they are prone to inheriting common human stereotypes and biases. This is problematic, because with their growing prominence they may further propagate these stereotypes (Sun et al., 2019). For example, interest is growing in mitigating bias in the field of machine translation, where systems such as Google translate were observed to default to translating gender-neutral pronouns as male pronouns, even with feminine cues (Savoldi et al.</description>

      <description>Anshuman Suri wrote up an interesting post on his experience with the MICO Challenge, a membership inference competition that was part of SaTML. Anshuman placed second in the competition (on the CIFAR data set), where the metric is highest true positive rate at a 0.1 false positive rate over a set of models (some trained using differential privacy and some without).&#xA;Anshuman&amp;rsquo;s post describes the methods he used and his experience in the competition: My submission to the MICO Challenge.</description>

      <description>Bleeping Computer has a story on our work (in collaboration with Microsoft Research) on poisoning code suggestion models:&#xA;Trojan Puzzle attack trains AI assistants into suggesting malicious code By Bill Toulas&#xA;Researchers at the universities of California, Virginia, and Microsoft have devised a new poisoning attack that could trick AI-based coding assistants into suggesting dangerous code.&#xA;Named &amp;lsquo;Trojan Puzzle,&amp;rsquo; the attack stands out for bypassing static detection and signature-based dataset cleansing models, resulting in the AI models being trained to learn how to reproduce dangerous payloads.</description>

      <description>(Cross-post by Anshuman Suri)&#xA;Distribution inference attacks aims to infer statistical properties of data used to train machine learning models. These attacks are sometimes surprisingly potent, as we demonstrated in previous work.&#xA;KL Divergence Attack Most attacks against distribution inference involve training a meta-classifier, either using model parameters in white-box settings (Ganju et al., Property Inference Attacks on Fully Connected Neural Networks using Permutation Invariant Representations, CCS 2018), or using model predictions in black-box scenarios (Zhang et al.</description>

      <title>Attribute Inference attacks are really Imputation</title>

      <description>Post by Bargav Jayaraman&#xA;Attribute inference attacks have been shown by prior works to pose privacy threat against ML models. However, these works assume the knowledge of the training distribution and we show that in such cases these attacks do no better than a data imputataion attack that does not have access to the model. We explore the attribute inference risks in the cases where the adversary has limited or no prior knowledge of the training distribution and show that our white-box attribute inference attack (that uses neuron activations to infer the unknown sensitive attribute) surpasses imputation in these data constrained cases.</description>
