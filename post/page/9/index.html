<p>Samin Yasar presented our paper on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09802"><em>Context-award Monitoring in
Robotic Surgery</em></a> at the 2019
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190416013641/http://www.ismr.gatech.edu/"><em>International Symposium on Medical
Robotics</em></a>
(ISMR) in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>

<p>Robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has enabled
procedures with increased precision and dexterity, but surgical robots
are still open loop and require surgeons to work with a tele-operation
console providing only limited visual feedback. In this setting,
mechanical failures, software faults, or human errors might lead to
adverse events resulting in patient complications or fatalities. We
argue that impending adverse events could be detected and mitigated by
applying context-specific safety constraints on the motions of the
robot. We present a context-aware safety monitoring system which
segments a surgical task into subtasks using kinematics data and
monitors safety constraints specific to each subtask. To test our
hypothesis about context specificity of safety constraints, we analyze
recorded demonstrations of dry-lab surgical tasks collected from the
JIGSAWS database as well as from experiments we conducted on a Raven
II surgical robot. Analysis of the trajectory data shows that each
subtask of a given surgical procedure has consistent safety
constraints across multiple demonstrations by different subjects. Our
preliminary results show that violations of these safety constraints
lead to unsafe events, and there is often sufficient time between the
constraint violation and the safety-critical event to allow for a
corrective action.</p>

<p>Several recent works have developed methods for training classifiers
that are certifiably robust against norm-bounded adversarial
perturbations. However, these methods assume that all the adversarial
transformations provide equal value for adversaries, which is seldom
the case in real-world applications. We advocate for cost-sensitive
robustness as the criteria for measuring the classifier&rsquo;s performance
for specific tasks. We encode the potential harm of different
adversarial transformations in a cost matrix, and propose a general
objective function to adapt the robust training method of Wong &amp;
Kolter (2018) to optimize for cost-sensitive robustness. Our
experiments on simple MNIST and CIFAR10 models and a variety of cost
matrices show that the proposed approach can produce models with
substantially reduced cost-sensitive robust error, while maintaining
classification accuracy.</p>

Secure multi-party computation (MPC) has evolved from a theoretical
curiosity in the 1980s to a tool for building real systems today. Over
the past decade, MPC has been one of the most active research areas in
both theoretical and applied cryptography. This book introduces
several important MPC protocols, and surveys methods for improving the
efficiency of privacy-preserving applications built using MPC. Besides
giving a broad overview of the field and the insights of the main
constructions, we overview the most currently active areas of MPC
research and aim to give readers insights into what problems are
practically solvable using MPC today and how different threat models
and assumptions impact the practicality of different approaches.

<center><b>Abstract</b></center>
Machine learning has produced extraordinary results over the past few years, and machine learning systems are rapidly being deployed for
critical tasks, even in adversarial environments.  This talk will survey some of the reasons building trustworthy machine learning
systems is inherently impossible, and dive into some recent research on adversarial examples. Adversarial examples are inputs crafted
deliberately to fool a machine learning system, often by making small, but targeted perturbations, starting from a natural seed example. Over the past few years, there has been an explosion of research in adversarial examples but we are only beginning to understand their
mysteries and just taking the first steps towards principled and effective defenses. The general problem of adversarial examples, however, has been at the core of information security for thousands of years. In this talk, I'll look at some of the long-forgotten lessons
from that quest, unravel the huge gulf between theory and practice in adversarial machine learning, and speculate on paths toward
trustworthy machine learning systems.

<p>Although researchers such as David Evans of the University of Virginia see a full explanation being a little way off in the future, the massive number of parameters encoded by DNNs and the avoidance of overtraining due to SGD may have an answer to why the networks can hallucinate images and, as a result, see things that are not there and ignore those that are.<br />
…<br />
He points to work by PhD student Mainuddin Jonas that shows how adversarial examples can push the output away from what we would see as the correct answer. “It could be just one layer [that makes the mistake]. But from our experience it seems more gradual. It seems many of the layers are being exploited, each one just a little bit. The biggest differences may not be apparent until the very last layer.”<br />
…<br />
Researchers such as Evans predict a lengthy arms race in attacks and countermeasures that may on the way reveal a lot more about the nature of machine learning and its relationship with reality.</p>
