<p>Xiao Zhang and my paper on <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=BygANhA9tQ&amp;noteId=BJe7cKRWeN"><em>Cost-Sensitive Robustness against Adversarial Examples</em></a> has been accepted to ICLR 2019.</p>
<p>Several recent works have developed methods for training classifiers
that are certifiably robust against norm-bounded adversarial
perturbations. However, these methods assume that all the adversarial
transformations provide equal value for adversaries, which is seldom
the case in real-world applications. We advocate for cost-sensitive
robustness as the criteria for measuring the classifier&rsquo;s performance
for specific tasks. We encode the potential harm of different
adversarial transformations in a cost matrix, and propose a general
objective function to adapt the robust training method of Wong &amp;
Kolter (2018) to optimize for cost-sensitive robustness. Our
experiments on simple MNIST and CIFAR10 models and a variety of cost
matrices show that the proposed approach can produce models with
substantially reduced cost-sensitive robust error, while maintaining
classification accuracy.</p>

<div class="abstract">
Secure multi-party computation (MPC) has evolved from a theoretical
curiosity in the 1980s to a tool for building real systems today. Over
the past decade, MPC has been one of the most active research areas in
both theoretical and applied cryptography. This book introduces
several important MPC protocols, and surveys methods for improving the
efficiency of privacy-preserving applications built using MPC. Besides
giving a broad overview of the field and the insights of the main
constructions, we overview the most currently active areas of MPC
research and aim to give readers insights into what problems are
practically solvable using MPC today and how different threat models
and assumptions impact the practicality of different approaches.

<center><b>Abstract</b></center>
Machine learning has produced extraordinary results over the past few years, and machine learning systems are rapidly being deployed for
critical tasks, even in adversarial environments.  This talk will survey some of the reasons building trustworthy machine learning
systems is inherently impossible, and dive into some recent research on adversarial examples. Adversarial examples are inputs crafted
deliberately to fool a machine learning system, often by making small, but targeted perturbations, starting from a natural seed example. Over the past few years, there has been an explosion of research in adversarial examples but we are only beginning to understand their
mysteries and just taking the first steps towards principled and effective defenses. The general problem of adversarial examples, however, has been at the core of information security for thousands of years. In this talk, I'll look at some of the long-forgotten lessons
from that quest, unravel the huge gulf between theory and practice in adversarial machine learning, and speculate on paths toward
trustworthy machine learning systems.

<p>Although researchers such as David Evans of the University of Virginia see a full explanation being a little way off in the future, the massive number of parameters encoded by DNNs and the avoidance of overtraining due to SGD may have an answer to why the networks can hallucinate images and, as a result, see things that are not there and ignore those that are.<br />
…<br />
He points to work by PhD student Mainuddin Jonas that shows how adversarial examples can push the output away from what we would see as the correct answer. “It could be just one layer [that makes the mistake]. But from our experience it seems more gradual. It seems many of the layers are being exploited, each one just a little bit. The biggest differences may not be apparent until the very last layer.”<br />
…<br />
Researchers such as Evans predict a lengthy arms race in attacks and countermeasures that may on the way reveal a lot more about the nature of machine learning and its relationship with reality.</p>

<p>The title and abstract are what I provided for the WOOT program, but unfortunately (or maybe fortunately for humanity!) I wasn&#8217;t able to actually figure out a talk to match the title and abstract I provided.</p>
<blockquote><p>
The history of security includes a long series of arms races, where a new technology emerges and is subsequently developed and exploited by both defenders and attackers. Over the past few years, &#8220;Artificial Intelligence&#8221; has re-emerged as a potentially transformative technology, and deep learning in particular has produced a barrage of amazing results. We are in the very early stages of understanding the potential of this technology in security, but more worryingly, seeing how it may be exploited by malicious individuals and powerful organizations. In this talk, I&#8217;ll look at what lessons might be learned from previous security arms races, consider how asymmetries in AI may be exploited by attackers and defenders, touch on some recent work in adversarial machine learning, and hopefully help progress-loving Luddites figure out how to survive in a world overrun by AI doppelgängers, GAN gangs, and gibbon-impersonating pandas.

<blockquote><p>
Earlier this week, 25 high school teachers – including 21 from Virginia – filled a glass-walled room in Rice Hall, sitting in high adjustable chairs at wheeled work tables, their laptops open, following a lecture with graphics about the dangers that lurk in cyberspace and trying to figure out how to pass the information on to a generation that seems to share the most intimate details of life online. &#8220;I think understanding privacy is important to that generation that uses Facebook and Snapchat,&#8221; said David Evans, a computer science professor who helped organize the camp. &#8220;We hope to give teachers some ideas and tools to get their students excited about learning about cryptography, privacy and cybersecurity, and how these things can impact them.&#8221;
