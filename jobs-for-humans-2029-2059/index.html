<p>I spoke first, following a few introductory talks, and was followed by
Nicole Smith and Ellen Scully-Russ, and a keynote from Dexter Manley,
Super Bowl winner with the Washington Redskins. After a short break,
Kavitha Cardoza moderated a very interesting panel discussion. A

<p>I want to start by talking about history. Machines taking jobs away from humans is not a new
thing - goes back hundreds of years.</p>
<p>The picture shows a match-making factory in the 1870s. No one has a job as this kind of match-maker today – and lots of the jobs the other kind of match-maker have also been taken over by machines.</p>

Another example is automated teller machine. ATMs automated many of
the roles previously done by human bank tellers.
</p><p>
ATM Machines didn’t eliminate jobs for bank tellers – actually made
more, since they make banking cheaper and more accessible, and meant
banks could open more branches which still needed to hire tellers for
the more interesting and complicated banking activities.
</p><p>
We’ve seen many transformations like this, and many tasks that could
once only be done by humans are now routinely automated. Although past
technological advances have caused massive disruption and pain for
many individuals, as a species on the whole, these advances have not
diminished overall human employment, and there shouldn’t be any doubt
that on the whole, technological and scientific program have made all
of our lives tremendously better.

One way to measure that progress is what fraction of our workforce is needed to feed us. 
</p>
<p>
As recently as 150 years ago, nearly everyone worked in agriculture, and we still couldn’t produce enough food to feed everyone. Now, only about 1 out of 75 people work in farming, and we are so ridiculously productive in producing food with we can burn about 1/3 of it as fuel.
</p>
<p>
So, if we were driven as a species to avoid work once our subsistence needs are met, we shouldn’t be working 8 hours or more a day.

Somehow we’ve managed improve productivity by a factor of several hundred, without reducing the demand for human work. All the previous scientific and technological progress that has automated work has just led to finding new productive things for humans to do.

<p>The question for today is if we are reaching the end of that – are the
kinds of automation that can be achieved (or soon will be) with
artificial intelligence that they won’t just improve productivity by
automating some human tasks, but that they will eliminate the
opportunity for humans to contribute productively at all.</p>
</p>
<p>
First, its important to distinguish AI from the traditional automation
that has driven productivity gains for the past hundred years.

<p>We’ve only experienced the disruption computing causes over the past
half century, but a few people had the vision of what was possible
much longer ago.</p>
</p>
<p>
The first person to see the potential for universal
computers, was Gottfried Leibniz back in the 17th century. 
</p>
<div class="quote">
<em>The human race will have a new kind of instrument which will increase the power of the mind much more than optical lenses strengthen the eyes and which will be as far superior to microscopes or telescopes as reason is superior to sight.</em><br>
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1679)
</div>
<p>
Leibniz is talking about increasing the power of our minds the way a telescope
increases the power of our eyes.  This is what traditional
computing has done. 
</p>
<p> 
More recently, Steve Jobs talked about computers as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&v=Pm_WAWZNbdA&feature=emb_logo">bicycles for the mind</a>.
  </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="column small-10 medium-5">
We have machines now that can do any computation we understand well enough to describe in simple steps quadrillions of times faster than humans can do it. We can also build computing systems, like the one most of us have in our pockets, that don’t just do one one human understands faster, but that can take the collective efforts of millions of humans over decades to make it possible for us to play “Angry Birds”.
  </div>
  <div class="column small-14 medium-7">

  <br></br>
</center>
<p>
All of the previous capabilities can only solve problems humans already understand well enough to solve.
</p>
<p>
AI allows us to solve problems no humans understand.
</p>
<p>
I’m going to focus now on Machine Learning, which is just one sub-field of AI, but it’s the one that has the most hype over the past decade, and one that is being rapidly deployed in ways that automate human tasks.
</p>
<p>
The main distinction between traditional computing and machine learning is that traditional automatons are programmed, while machine learning automatons are trained. Humans set up a training process, but the machine learns how to solve the problem on its own.
</p>

  <div class="column small-10 medium-5">
I’ll illustrate with a simple example – building a machine to distinguish women and men in pictures.
</p><p>
This is something most humans are quite good at, but if I asked you how you do it, you couldn’t explain it. And, since humans can’t explain how to do it, we don’t know how to write a program to do it, but we can train a model that does it well.
</p>
  </div>

  </div>
  <div class="column small-10 medium-5">
First, we need to collect training images.
</p>
<p>
<p>Training complex models requires a lot of training data – a few
million images. Fortunately, you can find billions of images on the
Internet (at least if you don&rsquo;t care about copyright; for the talk, I was allowed to
use these images, but they blurred them out of the recording).</p>

  <a href="/images/jobsforhumans/Slide14.png"><img src="/images/jobsforhumans/Slide14.png"></a>
  </div>
  <div class="column small-10 medium-5">
Next, we need to label the images. This is what is called <em>“supervised learning”</em> – we are telling the machine the correct answers, and it is training to find a model that matches those answers.
</p>
<p>
Labeling 10M images might seem like a lot of work, but you can <a href="http://vision.stanford.edu/pdf/ImageNet_CVPR2009.pdf">find low-paid humans to do it</a>.

  </div>
  <div class="column small-10 medium-5">
Now, we’re ready to train a model. But first, we need to decide on a model architecture. 
</p>
<p>
This just means designing a function with lots of unknown parameters that takes all the pixels of an images as its inputs, and outputs a prediction of gender and confidence.
</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="row" style="margin-top:10px">
  <div class="column small-14 medium-7">
  <a href="/images/jobsforhumans/Slide19.png"><img src="/images/jobsforhumans/Slide19.png"></a>
  </div>
  <div class="column small-10 medium-5">
We train the model by starting with random values for all those parameters, testing the labeled images, and updating the weights until we get a model that makes good predictions. 
</p>
<p>
There are some tricks for how to update the weights in the right direction, but if all goes well, we’ll find a model that has high accuracy on our tests before we run out of money.
</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="row" style="margin-top:10px">
  <div class="column small-10 medium-5">
<p>
Then we deploy the model and everything is great...
</p><p>
...except we see results like these. 
</p>
<p>
We have people that look like men, but are identified as women. What they have in common is they are carrying umbrellas.

These examples were provided by <a

results showing how ML models learn biases (and a method to mitigate this) are in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09457"><em>Men Also Like Shopping: Reducing Gender Bias Amplification using Corpus-level Constraints</em></a>, 
Jieyu Zhao, Tianlu Wang, Mark Yatskar, Vicente Ordonez, Kai-Wei Chang. (In <em>Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing</em> (EMNLP) 2017.)

The umbrella-revealing-gender example is from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08489"><em>Balanced Datasets Are Not Enough: Estimating and Mitigating Gender Bias in Deep Image Representations</em></a> by Tianlu Wang, Jieyu Zhao, Mark Yatskar, Kai-Wei Chang, Vicente Ordonez.

</div>
  </div>
  <div class="column small-10 medium-5">
The problem is the learning process is just about learning statistical patterns in data – the model is not developing any real understanding of men and women. 
</p><p>
Since most of the people in the labeled data who were holding umbrellas were women, the model learned a strong pattern that if you are holding an umbrella you must be a woman.
</p><p>
Being mis-gendered because of holding an umbrella may not be such a serious problem, but the same kinds of learning methods are used in many more sensitive tasks, like predicting who is a terrorist and who gets a job interview.

Predicting exponential growth is the easiest and safest prediction

that stops the growth – Malthus thought we were at the limit of how
much an acre of land could produce in 1800 – but you can see from the
graph on the right that we weren’t, and this is one of the reasons he
got things so wrong.  </p>

The main challenge isn’t predicting the exponential growth, it is guess how much more growth is needed for things to work – that is, what are the labels on the vertical axis.

One property of exponential curves, is if you zoom in on any part of them, they look basically the same.

When autonomous vehicles started to work in 2005, if you thought we
were on a curve like this and only needed to get about 100<em>x</em> better,
you were at risk of making really bad predictions.

<p>If you saw the rate of improvement in autonomous vehicles from 2004 to
2016 and extrapolated continued exponential growth, maybe it wasn&rsquo;t so
unreasonable to predict in 2016 that we would have coast-to-coast full
autonomy by 2017.</p>

Of course, now we know it was a lot further off.

<p>Even though its easy to predict exponential change, it is hard to

point where something actually works well enough to have an impact.</p>

By 1803, one person could – Thomas Jefferson envisioned the Lewis and Clark expedition.

It cost $50,000 in 1803 dollars, which is hard to convert, but let’s guess about $100M. <p class="aside">Congressional appropriation methods, however, haven't changed much - the initial request, shown in the letter, was for $2,500.</p>

By 1903, we had telephones. If you were really rich and important you could have one in your office.
</p>
<p>
A 3-minute call from NY to Chicago cost $5.45 in 1903 dollars. <p class="aside">I couldn’t find out if you could call from Washington to California, and adjusting for inflation is tough, but somewhere around a few thousand current dollars seems reasonable.</p>

<p>Sending messages has gotten so ridiculously cheap, spam is profitable
and researchers work on ways to <a href="http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~naor/PAPERS/pvp.pdf">artificially make sending messages

One way to think about the jobs of the future is to predict when the
cost of automating the job will drop below the cost of hiring a human
to do it today.

<p>
Nearly all individual jobs could be automated today, if you invested
enough in a special-purpose solution and in training the machine to do
that specific job.

conclusion until I get to the third one.</p>

<p>It is well worth taking a tour of an Amazon Fulfillment Center. Other
than conveyer belts, scanners, and fork lifts, there are not many many
machines operating the warehouse — nearly all the work is done
by humans, being told by software what to do. </p></p>
<p>
Its cheaper to get
humans to do this work since it is physically complex, varied, and
high skill, but the skills required to do it are readily available and
not highly valued by the marketplace, so humans with such skills can
be hired at low cost and easily replaced when necessary. It'll be a
long time before it is cheaper to do these jobs by machine.

<p>Unfortunately for me, and most of us in this room (unlike Dexter Manley,
pictured, who was our keynote speaker), we don’t have the
athletic talents to succeed as professional athletes.</p>

In the future, we should <em>all</em> have jobs like these!

Everyone should have a job that values their intrinsic humanity, and
technology will soon advance to the point where we all can. In many
ways (recall the diminishing percentage of our workforce employed in
agriculture from earlier) we already have. We just have
to face the challenge of restructuring society to make this work.
